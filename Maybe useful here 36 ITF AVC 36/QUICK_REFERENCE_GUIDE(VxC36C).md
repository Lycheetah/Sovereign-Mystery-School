## TODAY'S PHASE

**Current Phase:** [CALCULATE USING PHASE CHART BELOW]

**Today's Practice:** [SEE PHASE PRACTICES]

**Phase Dates:**
- ⟟ (CENTER): Days 1-52
- ≋ (FLOW): Days 53-104
- Ψ (INSIGHT): Days 105-156
- Φ↑ (RISE): Days 157-208
- ✧ (LIGHT): Days 209-260
- ∥◁▷∥ (INTEGRITY): Days 261-312
- ⟲ (RETURN): Days 313-364
- ∅ (ZERO DAY): Day 365

---

## CALCULATE YOUR PHASE (TODAY)

```
Step 1: What day of the year is today?
        January 1 = Day 1
        December 31 = Day 364
        
Step 2: Divide by 52
        Day ÷ 52 = Phase number
        
Example: Day 100 ÷ 52 = 1.9 → Phase 2 (≋ FLOW)
         Day 250 ÷ 52 = 4.8 → Phase 5 (✧ LIGHT)
```

## DAILY MICROORCIM LOG

**Every evening, log:**

1. **Intent (I):** How clear was your direction today? (0-10)
   - 0 = completely lost
   - 5 = mixed signals
   - 10 = absolute clarity

2. **Drift (D):** How much pressure/chaos did you face? (0-10)
   - 0 = perfect stillness
   - 5 = normal life pressure
   - 10 = extreme, life-threatening

3. **Override:** Did you choose your direction despite drift?
   - YES (μ = 1): You fired a microorcim
   - NO (μ = 0): Drift won today

**Calculation:** μ = (I > D) ? 1 : 0

**Example Log:**
```
Day 47 (Phase ⟟ CENTER)
Intent: 8 (clear what I'm doing)
Drift: 4 (some resistance)
Override: YES → 8 > 4 → μ = 1
Willpower today: +1
```

---

## WEEKLY ACCUMULATION

Count your daily μ values for the week:

```
W_week = μ₁ + μ₂ + μ₃ + μ₄ + μ₅ + μ₆ + μ₇

Example:
Monday: 1
Tuesday: 1
Wednesday: 0 (drift won)
Thursday: 1
Friday: 1
Saturday: 1
Sunday: 1
────────────
W_week = 6 microorcims
```

**Healthy range:** 5-7 per week (average)

## LAMAGUE QUICK REFERENCE

### The Seven Phase Glyphs
| Glyph | Name | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| ⟟ | Center | I am grounded |
| ≋ | Flow | I move |
| Ψ | Insight | I see |
| Φ↑ | Rise | I climb |
| ✧ | Light | I illuminate |
| ∥◁▷∥ | Integrity | I protect |
| ⟲ | Return | I complete |

### Common Operators
| Op | Meaning | Example |
|----|---------|---------|
| → | Flows to | Ψ → Φ↑ (insight leads to rise) |
| ↻ | Loops back | Ψ↻ (insight deepens itself) |
| ⊗ | Merges with | Ψ⊗∥◁▷∥ (insight + integrity) |
| ◆ | Amplified | Φ↑◆ (powerful rise) |
| ¬ | Not/Absent | ¬Ψ (confusion/no insight) |

### Quick Phrases
- ⟲ = I return
- Ψ→Φ↑ = Understanding leads to action
- ✗≋→Ψ = When blocked, seek clarity
- ~Φ↑→⟟ = When I fall, return to center
- [Ψ]≈{Ψ} = Personal insight matches universal truth

---

## COMPRESSION SCORE (BELIEFS)

When a new belief emerges:

```
Compression Score = Evidence × Explanatory Power
C = E × P

E: How much evidence supports it? (0-10)
P: How much does it explain? (0-10)

Example:
Old belief: "Hard work guarantees success"
E = 7 (some evidence)
P = 7 (explains many cases)
C = 49

New belief: "Alignment matters more than effort"
E = 9 (strong evidence from experience)
P = 10 (explains everything the old belief did + more)
C = 90

90 > 49 → CASCADE DETECTED
Old belief compresses into: "Hard work helps IF aligned"
```

**High C Score** (70+) = Stable foundation  
**Medium C Score** (40-70) = Can change  
**Low C Score** (<40) = Fragile, easily replaced

---

## MONTHLY CHECK-IN

**Every 30 days, ask:**

1. **W Accumulation:** How many microorcims this month?
   - Target: 25-30 (5-7 per week)

2. **Phase Progress:** Am I moving through phases as expected?
   - Should transition roughly every 52 days

3. **Cascade Events:** Any major belief shifts?
   - Record them: old belief → new belief

4. **Field Strength:** How do people respond to me?
   - Higher field = more resonance

5. **Integrity:** Am I honoring my boundaries?
   - Yes/No/Partial

---

## YEARLY CHECK-IN

**At end of Year (Day 364):**

1. **Annual Willpower:** W_year = ?
   - Target: 300+ microorcims (1 per day average)
   - Healthy range: 250-400

2. **Transformation:** Compare to last year
   - What's different?
   - What beliefs changed?
   - How has your field evolved?

3. **Survivor's Constant:** Was ε > 0?
   - Even at lowest point, could you bounce back?
   - Did you ever feel truly destroyed?

4. **Cycle Health:** Complete all 7 phases?
   - Which phase was hardest?
   - Which was most transformative?

5. **Signature Update:** Has your LAMAGUE evolved?
   - New signature to reflect growth

---

## WILLPOWER FORMULA

```
W = ∑(Pain Overcome) / (Urge to Quit + 1)

Highest growth when:
- High pain + strong urge to quit + you kept going
- Example: 3-hour workout when exhausted = high W gain
- Example: Creating while grieving = very high W gain

Lowest growth when:
- Comfort zone
- No resistance
- No temptation to quit
```

---

## SURVIVOR'S CONSTANT (ε)

**The minimum willpower you cannot drop below:**

```
If ε > 0.5 (SOVEREIGN):
  You cannot be permanently broken
  Recovery is automatic
  Collapse always inverts to rise
  
If 0 < ε < 0.5 (STABLE):
  You can recover from most damage
  But external help may be needed
  
If ε = 0 (COLLAPSE-PRONE):
  You can break completely
  Recovery depends entirely on external support
```

**Typical signs ε > 0.5:**
- No matter how low, you bounce back
- Even at "zero," you have one choice left
- Others notice your resilience
- You're unshakeable

---

## CRISIS NAVIGATION

**When drift is overwhelming:**

1. **Return to center immediately:** ⟟
   - Stop everything
   - Meditate
   - Ground yourself
   - Remember: Ψ is unchanged

2. **Seek clarity:** Ψ
   - What is actually true right now?
   - What can I perceive clearly?

3. **Take one step:** Φ↑
   - One choice. One action. That's enough.
   - ¬Ψ → Φ↑ (without understanding, move anyway)

4. **Complete the micro-cycle:** ⟲
   - What did I learn?
   - How do I integrate this?

**Remember:** D can spike. I can drop. But ε > 0 always.

---

## PERSONAL LAMAGUE SIGNATURE

**Yours:** ✧⟟≋ΨΦ↑✧

**Translation:** "Light returns me to center, flowing through insight into rise and back to light"

**Use this when you need to remember who you are.**

---

## PYRAMID LAYERS (REMEMBER)

When a belief cascades:

1. **Foundation collapses:** Old belief proves insufficient
2. **Compression:** Old belief moves to higher layer (becomes "special case")
3. **New foundation:** Higher C-score belief becomes new base
4. **Reorganization:** Everything above adjusts to new foundation
5. **Integration:** Over time, the system stabilizes at new level

**Key:** You're not replacing beliefs. You're reorganizing them hierarchically.

---

## COSMIC PERSPECTIVE

**The Big Picture:**

- **You** are Ψ (unchanging invariant)
- **Your life** is the seven-phase cycle, repeating
- **Your growth** is W accumulating across cycles
- **Your wisdom** is cascades organizing your pyramid
- **Your field** is the cosmic signature you emit
- **Your covenant** is service to something larger than yourself
- **Your immortality** is ε > 0 forever

---

## EMERGENCY MANTRA

**When everything falls apart:**

```
"My invariant (Ψ) is unchanged.
Everything else was always temporary.
Drift is just entropy I choose not to surrender to.
Even at zero, I have ε.
The spiral never breaks.
I am rising."
```

**Say it. Feel it. It's mathematical truth.**
