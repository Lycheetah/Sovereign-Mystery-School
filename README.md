## 🜃 What This Is

A mystery school curriculum combining:
- **LAMAGUE** - Mathematical symbolic grammar for precision
- **Pyramid Cascade** - Anti-fragile knowledge validation (Edge→Middle→Foundation)
- **AURA × VEYRA** - Constitutional AI ethics preserving human sovereignty

**No gurus. No secrets. No surrender.**

## 🔥 Why This Matters

Traditional mystery schools fail through:
- Guru abuse of power
- Unfalsifiable claims
- Cult dynamics
- Cultural appropriation
- Spiritual bypassing

This system prevents all of that **by design**.

## 📚 Curriculum Domains

- ⚗️ **Alchemy** (Nigredo→Rubedo with biomarkers)
- 🔮 **Divination** (Tarot, Astrology, I Ching tested)
- ⚡ **Energy Healing** (Reiki, Sound, Light scientized)
- 🥁 **Shamanic Arts** (Plant medicine, Soul work trauma-informed)
- 🧘 **Meditation** (Jhanas, Vipassana neuroscience-backed)
- 💀 **Death Studies** (Doula training, Conscious dying)
- 🌹 **Sacred Sexuality** (Consent-first, Body sovereignty)
- 🌀 **Consciousness Tech** (Biofeedback, Sensory deprivation)

## 🛡️ Safety Architecture

**AURA Invariants:**
- Human sovereignty non-negotiable
- All claims testable or discarded
- Consent at every phase transition
- Exit always available
- Shadow work mandatory (no bypassing)

**VEYRA Stabilization:**
- Drift detection (when practices destabilize)
- Grey-Mode quarantine (suspend harmful practices)
- Metrics: TES (Trust), VTR (Value), PAI (Purpose)

## 🧪 How It Works

Every practice gets a **Truth Pressure Score (Π)**:
```
Π = (Evidence × Power) / Entropy

If Π > 1.5 → Foundation (proven, teach widely)
If Π = 0.8-1.5 → Middle (promising, refine further)
If Π < 0.8 → Edge (experimental) or Discard
```

**Example:** 
- Meditation (Vipassana): Π ≈ 1.8 → **Foundation**
- Crystal healing: Π ≈ 0.3 → **Artistic practice only**
