1. Focus on smooth transitions


**Total Program Time Commitment**: 870 minutes (14.5 hours)

### Evidence Base

**Key Studies**:
- Lehrer et al. (2000) - Heart rate variability biofeedback
- Zaccaro et al. (2018) - How breath-control affects brain
- Brown & Gerbarg (2005) - Sudarshan Kriya yoga


**Known Mechanisms**:
- Increased HRV (autonomic balance)
- Reduced cortisol (stress hormone)
- Vagal tone enhancement (parasympathetic activation)
- Prefrontal cortex activation (executive function)


### Predicted Outcomes


**Anxiety**
- Expected Effect Size: 0.55 (Cohen's d)
- Interpretation: Medium
- Direction: Decrease

**HRV**
- Expected Effect Size: 0.60 (Cohen's d)
- Interpretation: Medium
- Direction: Increase

**Perceived Stress**
- Expected Effect Size: 0.50 (Cohen's d)
- Interpretation: Medium
- Direction: Decrease


**Average Expected Effect Size**: 0.55 (medium)

### Measurement Instruments


**Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)**
- Range: 0-21
- Reliability: α = 0.92
- Validity: r = 0.89
- Reference: Spitzer et al. (2006)


### Reality Anchors (Auto-Generated)

These measurement points will be used to validate the practice against reality:


**Anxiety**
- Scale: GAD-7
- Baseline: 14.7
- Expected Change: -11.6
- Timeline: 42 days
- Validation Strength: VERY_STRONG


### Safety Information

**Contraindications**:
- Severe respiratory conditions
- Recent heart surgery
- Uncontrolled hypertension


**Red Flags** (Stop practice and seek support if these occur):
- Dizziness or fainting
- Chest pain
- Severe shortness of breath
- Hyperventilation syndrome


### Quality Assurance

This protocol has been generated using:
- Validated measurement instruments
- Evidence-based predicted outcomes
- LAMAGUE mathematical modeling
- Automatic reality anchor generation
- Statistical validation framework

**Compliance with CASCADE Reality Bridge**: ✓ Enabled

All claims in this protocol are falsifiable and will be automatically
evaluated against measured reality through the Reality Bridge system.

If predicted outcomes do not match measured reality, this practice
will be automatically demoted or removed from the curriculum.
